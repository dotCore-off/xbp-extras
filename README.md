## xenin-battlepass
This is an unofficial repository made regarding the Xenin Battlepass script and custom systems made by me.

## Original script
Only edited files will be uploaded there, this means this won't be functional if you do not own all original ones.
Please, before doing anything, buy it here : https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/xenin-battle-pass.
This is not a leak or whatever, don't expect those things from me.

## Support and updates
Support and updates will be given in case you politely ask for and that's regarding the edited files.
Whereas, don't expect a fast support or whatever, I'm not paid for doing this (and that's normal).
Also, note that I'll redirect you to the official support server if you have a problem with the addon itself.

## Edited files author
These editions have been made by dotCore.
They're not of the same quality than the original code, and might not be optimized or may not work as expected.
I can't be held as responsible for any damages / issues on your server.
